## Overview
This school project has for objectives to help student better understand programming fundamentals and the first use of a graphic library like Pygame.
For this project we recived a already existing script (mm.py) and it was our goal to make a Mastermind game using this script.
</br>
This project is the result of my work, it's a simple game of Mastermind with some differents in the rules : 9 colors, 5 pegs and 15 tries.

- **mastermind_sae101.py**: The main script containing the game loop and logic made by me.
- **mm.py**: A file containing the different tuples for the differents colors used and some fonction for randering the board.
